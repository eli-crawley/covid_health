# Data Analysis Notebooks  

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for various data analyses related  adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines. The analysis covers different demographic factors such as age, gender, location, and vaccine manufacturer data. The goal is to derive insights from the VAERS dataset and contribute to a better understanding vaccine-related trends. 

## Objective

1. Determine the impact vaccines have on males and females. 

2. Establish if any states have a higher risk of an adverse or death event.

3. Learn which, if any, vaccine manufacturer has a higher risk for an adverse or death event. 

4. Discover trends on an age basis and determine which groups are more at risk. 

## Notebooks  

1. **Gender Analysis (`gender_analysis.ipynb`)**  
   - Examines the gender distribution in the data.  
   - Includes visualizations and insights based on gender-based data.

2. **Location Analysis (`location_analysis.ipynb`)**  
   - Analyzes geographical data and trends.  
   - Includes visualizations and insights based on location-based data.  

3. **Vaccine Manufacturer Analysis (`vac_manu_analysis.ipynb`)**  
   - Evaluates data related to vaccine manufacturers.  
   - Compares production, distribution, and other relevant metrics.  

4. **Age Analysis (`age_analysis.ipynb`)**  
   - Examines age distribution data.  
   - Identifies trends and patterns across different age groups.  

## Dataset

VAERSDATA1 (3).csv â€“ The primary dataset containing vaccine adverse event data, sourced from VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System). 

## Requirements  

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the notebooks:  

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage

Open the notebooks using Jupyter"
