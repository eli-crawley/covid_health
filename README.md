# Covid Vaccine Adverse Reaction Analysis 2020-2024

## Introduction
This project analyzes adverse reactions to vaccines using a dataset that includes patient demographics, vaccine manufacturers, geographic distribution, and gender-based reactions. The analysis aims to identify trends in adverse reactions and fatalities associated with vaccinations.

## Table of Contents
- [Introduction](#introduction)
- [Age Analysis](#1-age-analysis)
- [Vaccine Manufacturer Analysis](#2-vaccine-manufacturer-analysis)
- [Location Analysis](#3-location-analysis)
- [Gender Analysis](#4-gender-analysis)
- [Summation](#summation)
  

## Objective

1. Determine the impact vaccines have on males and females. 

2. Establish if any states have a higher risk of an adverse or death event.

3. Learn which, if any, vaccine manufacturer has a higher risk for an adverse or death event. 

4. Discover trends on an age basis and determine which groups are more at risk. 

## Notebooks  

1. **Gender Analysis (`gender_analysis.ipynb`)**  
   - Examines the gender distribution in the data.  
   - Includes visualizations and insights based on gender-based data.

2. **Location Analysis (`location_analysis.ipynb`)**  
   - Analyzes geographical data and trends.  
   - Includes visualizations and insights based on location-based data.

3. **Vaccine Manufacturer Analysis (`vac_manu_analysis.ipynb`)**  
   - Evaluates data related to vaccine manufacturers.  
   - Compares production, distribution, and other relevant metrics.  

4. **Age Analysis (`age_analysis.ipynb`)**  
   - Examines age distribution data.  
   - Identifies trends and patterns across different age groups.
